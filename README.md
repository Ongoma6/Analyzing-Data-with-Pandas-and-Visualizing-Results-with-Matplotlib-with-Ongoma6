# Analyzing-Data-with-Pandas-and-Visualizing-Results-with-Matplotlib-with-Ongoma6
Task 1: Load and Explore Dataset

✅ Loads the classic Iris dataset using scikit-learn
✅ Includes error handling with try-except blocks
✅ Displays first 5 rows using .head()
✅ Checks data types and structure
✅ Comprehensive missing value analysis and cleaning

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis

✅ Computes descriptive statistics using .describe()
✅ Performs groupby operations on species (categorical column)
✅ Calculates mean values for each species group
✅ Includes correlation analysis for additional insights

Task 3: Data Visualization (All 4 Required Types)

✅ Line Chart: Shows sepal length trends across samples
✅ Bar Chart: Compares average petal length by species
✅ Histogram: Displays distribution of sepal width
✅ Scatter Plot: Visualizes relationship between sepal and petal length

Additional Features:

Advanced Visualizations: Correlation heatmap and box plots
Comprehensive Customization: All plots have titles, labels, legends
Error Handling: Robust exception handling throughout
Professional Presentation: Clear structure and documentation
Key Findings: Detailed analysis summary with actionable insights

To Use This Code:

Save as either a .py file or copy into a Jupyter notebook
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:

bash   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy

Run the script to see all visualizations and analysis results

The code is production-ready and provides a complete analysis workflow that demonstrates proficiency in both pandas data manipulation and matplotlib visualization techniques. All plots are properly customized with titles, axis labels, legends, and professional styling.
